#Study Design
This section describes how the data for the Coursera Getting and Cleaning Data project was collected and summarised.
The Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset is obtained from http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones.

> The original data contains 
> 1)	identifiers for each subject who carried out the experiment, 
> 2)	activity identifiers and labels and 
> 3)	normalised measurements from the accelerometer and gyroscope (features) within [-1,1].

The run_analysis.R script produces two tables: 
- merged.data that contains subject, activity and measurements on the mean and standard deviation of the feature information after merging the test and training data.
- tidy.mean that contains the calculated average of the mean and standard deviation of the feature measurements for each combination of subject and activity that exists.

###Process
* X_test.txt/X_train.txt were merged into the feature dataset of 10299 rows and 561 columns
* y_test.txt/y_train.txt were merged into the activity dataset of 10299 rows and 2 columns
subject_test.txt /subject_train.txt were merged into the subject dataset of 10299 rows
* Out of the original 561 feature measurements 33 are identified containing mean data and 33 with standard deviations. 
* Activity identifiers are replaced by descriptive activity labels from activity_labels.txt.

##Code Book
*Merged.data therefore consist of 10,299 observations for the following variables:*

*In Tidy.mean the variables are the same as above but the features are averages of each of the columns for each activity and each subject.*

Additional detail on the features can be found in features_info.txt:

â€œThe features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.
- tBodyAcc-XYZ
tGravityAcc-XYZ
tBodyAccJerk-XYZ
tBodyGyro-XYZ
tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ
tBodyAccMag
tGravityAccMag
tBodyAccJerkMag
tBodyGyroMag
tBodyGyroJerkMag
fBodyAcc-XYZ
fBodyAccJerk-XYZ
fBodyGyro-XYZ
fBodyAccMag
fBodyAccJerkMag
fBodyGyroMag
fBodyGyroJerkMag

Additional vectors obtained by averaging the signals in a signal window sample. These are used on the angle() variable:
- gravityMean
tBodyAccMean
tBodyAccJerkMean
tBodyGyroMean
tBodyGyroJerkMean
